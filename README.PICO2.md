# Pico Compatibility

Although this book was published in the UK shortly before [the announcement of the Pico 2 and RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/), the author and editor both had access to prerelease versions of the board and MicroPython firmware.

As to why we did not wait until the Pico 2 was released to publish the book, we did not want to wait any longer than necessary to publish this new edition: it was over three years old, and lacked coverage of the Pico W, so it was severely out of date and no longer served the needs of readers.

Fortunately, the book is based on MicroPython, which is intended to remain source-compatible with the original Pico's MicroPython, so we anticipate no need to update anything in the example code. The Pico 2 is pin-compatible, so the circuit design remains the same.

However, as of the date of the Pico 2 announcement, [MicroPython for the Pico 2](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO2/) was only in preview mode. As the MicroPython firmware moves from preview to final release, we will test the examples with the new Pico 2, under both ARM and RISC-V firmware, and will issue errata if the need arises.
