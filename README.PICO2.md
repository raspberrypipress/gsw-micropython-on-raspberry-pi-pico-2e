# Pico Compatibility

Although this book was published in the UK shortly before [the announcement of the Pico 2 and RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/), the author and editor both had access to prerelease versions of the board and MicroPython firmware.

As to why we did not wait until the Pico 2 was released to publish the book, we did not want to wait any longer than necessary to publish this new edition: it was over three years old, and lacked coverage of the Pico W, so it was severely out of date and no longer served the needs of readers.

With the release of the Pico 2, there have been some small changes that have affected the example code, and in some cases, have required a change to the circuit diagram. We will incorporate these new diagrams in an upcoming printing of the book. Until then, you can find the updated circuit diagrams as PNG files in the subdirectories below `eg/`, along with updated source code.
